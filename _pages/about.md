I'm a first-year master’s degree student from [School of Management](http://www7.zzu.edu.cn/glxy/), [Zhengzhou University](https://www.zzu.edu.cn/). My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, data mining, and fault diagnosis.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. TongNiu](https://www7.zzu.edu.cn/glxy/info/1501/5170.htm) from [School of Management](http://www7.zzu.edu.cn/glxy/), Zhengzhou University.
